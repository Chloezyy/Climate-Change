The nuanced analysis of high-dimensional time series data holds paramount impor- tance across various fields, including economics, finance, and engineering, demands sophisticated modeling techniques that can accurately capture dynamic interdepen- dencies and forecast future observations. This paper centers on the critical role of high-dimensionality within the realm of Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, empha- sizing the pivotal influence of lag order in sculpting the analytical structure of time series data. Acknowledging the complexity and variety of temporal relationships in high-dimensional datasets, this study innovates by analyzing the performance of vari- ous established methodologies, specifically, factor adjusted models (DFM and FAVAR), Lasso regression, and Information Criteria, across different lag order structures. Our study embarks on a detailed examination of these methodologies’ ability to navigate the challenges posed by high-dimensional time series data, particularly emphasizing the differential impact of various lag order configurations on model performance. By systematically comparing these models across structures, we aim to unveil nuanced in- sights into each approach’s forecasting accuracy and adaptability in capturing intricate data dependencies.
